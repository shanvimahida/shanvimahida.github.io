### About Me
I’m currently an eighth grader planning to pursue a career in healthcare. My life wasn’t always and still isn’t fully planned out but I’ve been drawn to helping others for as long as I can remember. Even as a kid I was so intrigued by Rapunzel’s magical healing hair, so much so that I may have attempted to use my own hair to cure a few papercuts over the years. Whether it's lending a hand at the library or taking responsibility for my own younger brother, I find meaning in caring for people and helping them feel seen and supported. I’m still exploring healthcare, wondering if I want to go into pediatrics, psychology or something else - but I’m excited to be learning at every pothole and fork in the road. 

### Experiences
- Volunteers at the local library
- CPR and First Aid certified by Red Cross

I’ve participated in countless extracurriculars throughout my life such as gymnastics, robotics, and dance although I eventually stuck with swimming - a sport I have done since I was three - and volleyball, my newfound passion. Both have taught me diligence, time management, stamina, goal-setting, discipline, and so much more. Sports have taught me to overcome mental blocks and provide me a way to reset while allowing me to push through challenges.

### What I'm Exploring
- I’m truly fascinated by the world of both biology and psychology
- I’ve recently begun working on a phone application too
- Through reading medical stories and books my love for healthcare has grown
- I’m working on public speaking and building connections with a large range of people
- I’m open to multiple medical positions and topics such as genetics, psychology, neurology, and pediatrics
