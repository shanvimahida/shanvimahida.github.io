  <h2>Empathy-led and people - focused, I’m chasing purpose not perfection.</h2>
    <p> Hi, I’m Shanvi Mahida, a teenager with a growing passion for medicine who’s still discovering her path but is committed to helping people along the way. I love working with people - especially kids - and I’m living life along the words of Hippocrates: 
“Wherever the art of medicine is loved, there is also a love of humanity.” I may not have it all figured out just yet but I’m using empathy and curiosity to learn and grow every step of the way.
