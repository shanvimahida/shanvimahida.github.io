<H1> Welcome to Shanvi Mahida Personal Website </H1>
<H2> Hi, I'm Shanvi Mahida and this is my online portfolio </H2>

### About Me
I’m currently an eighth grader planning to pursue a career in healthcare. My life wasn’t always and still isn’t fully planned out but I’ve been drawn to helping others for as long as I can remember. Even as a kid I was so intrigued by Rapunzel’s magical healing hair, so much so that I may have attempted to use my own hair to cure a few papercuts over the years. Whether it's lending a hand at the library or taking responsibility for my own younger brother, I find meaning in caring for people and helping them feel seen and supported. I’m still exploring healthcare, wondering if I want to go into pediatrics, psychology or something else - but I’m excited to be learning at every pothole and fork in the road. 

### Experiences
- Volunteers at the local library
- CPR and First Aid certified by Red Cross
I’ve participated in countless extracurriculars throughout my life such as gymnastics, robotics, and dance although I eventually stuck with swimming - a sport I have done since I was three - and volleyball, my newfound passion. Both have taught me diligence, time management, stamina, goal-setting, discipline, and so much more. Sports have taught me to overcome mental blocks and provide me a way to reset while allowing me to push through challenges - something I know will prove useful in healthcare too. 

### What I'm Exploring
- I’m truly fascinated by the world of both biology and psychology
- I’ve recently begun working on a phone application called “Pill Smart” to improve the lives of those who take any and all medications… Click the Link! (insert link)
- Through reading books such as “The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat” by Oliver Sacks my love for healthcare has grown
- Even kid shows like “Doogie Kamealoha, M.D.” hold a special place in my heart when it comes to medicine
- I’m working on public speaking and building connections with a large range of people
- I’m open to multiple medical positions and topics such as genetics, psychology, neurology, and pediatrics
